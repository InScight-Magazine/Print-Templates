The news flashes across the television screen one fine morning: The proportion of aquatic life affected due to microfiber pollution is currently at 100 million: The number rises everyday!
You pause to look for a second with the laundry in your hand, maybe turn the volume up. As you load the clothes in the washing machine, turn the knobs, you shake your head at the state of the times, even telling your toddler that climate change should be fought against. However, do you pause as you chuck that blue shirt into the machine and wonder what the enemy looks like? Well you don’t have to look that far. The blue shirt and millions like it, or in other words, any kind of textile and fibre are one of the primary reasons for microfiber pollution. 
#h-image(path: "/images/himg.jpg", caption: "This is a really long caption which should demonstrate how lines break in captions.", position: top, width: 40%)
Synthetic textiles, which are made up of polyester, nylon, acrylic and other fibres, almost singly contribute to engineered micro-plastics in the ocean, accounting for 35 percent of the total volume. These microfibers are released from fabric, which can be as small as three microns, a thirteenth the width of a single strand of your hair, are too small for water treatment plants to remove.
These invisible minions make their way into the ocean at large scale, allow organic pollutants like DDT and PBTs to attach, and accumulate in the bodies of the aquatic life like fish, and its consumers like birds and humans, becoming more and more toxic with increasing concentrations. According to a researcher at the University of Plymouth, up to 700,000 micro-fibres can shed from a 6 kg household load of textiles. And thus every time you chuck that skirt in for a wash, you plot for death of aquatic life across an acre of ocean.
So what is the way out? Should we go back to the Stone-Age and live off bark skin and leaves and discard textiles totally? Well that might be a nice way to spend a summer afternoon but definitely isn’t practical enough for today’s life. 
However, a certain Rachel Miller wasn’t ready to sit with her hands on her lap. A marine archaeologist and a windsurfing instructor went to help clean up an island off the coast of Maine in the north-east of the US in 2009. There had been a heavy storm, and she found the beach covered in debris, most of which was washed-up fishing gear. And that made the film-roll click into place and Rachel made up her mind to make a difference – prevent plastics from ever reaching the ocean.
